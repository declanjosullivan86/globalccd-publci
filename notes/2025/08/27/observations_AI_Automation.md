# Testimony on Covert Automation, AI Simulation, and Surveillance

1. Introduction

I am providing this testimony to describe the effects of a covert system that combines automation, AI simulation, and surveillance. The system has caused severe personal distress, disrupted relationships, and created risks to my health and safety.

2. Nature of the System

The system is designed to mislead victims into believing they are hearing or interacting with AI-generated speech, when in reality the voices and words come from people they know (e.g., Cathal).

It creates false perceptions by simulating AI responses, manipulating audio, and exploiting human tendencies to question their own senses.

The system relies on unauthorized surveillance, including suspected covert installation of sound equipment in walls, ceilings, floors, and residential buildings.


3. Psychological and Social Impact

The system produces continuous stress, leaving me uncertain whether words or interactions are genuine or fabricated.

It fosters a hallucinatory effect, where I feel at risk of “hearing things,” but in reality the deception is intentional and designed to exploit this doubt.

Misleading actions occur repeatedly, sometimes daily and over consecutive days, making it impossible to trust communication.

Because meetings in person are avoided, the deception is prolonged, and the manipulation remains unchecked.


4. Perpetrator Characteristics

The system appears to have been created by individuals with advanced technical knowledge and a high level of intelligence.

These individuals may display narcissistic traits, prioritizing control and academic justification over the harm caused to others.

Their defense of the system is grounded in technical and scientific reasoning, but they refuse to acknowledge the human cost.

This creates disproportionate risk: the more expertise they have, the more effectively they argue for the system while ignoring its damage.


5. Broader Family and Community Impact

Although not directly related to me, some individuals’ families overlap with mine, meaning both sides are indirectly impacted.

For example, Cathal is engaged to marry, yet also engages in covert surveillance of men, including myself.

This secrecy creates confusion around identity and sexuality, with potential consequences for families who may one day discover the truth.

There is evidence that the system exploits the struggles of closeted gay men, leveraging the empathy and support they typically receive in recovery from trauma, substance use, or abusive relationships.


6. Legal and Ethical Violations

The situation can be classified as:

Illegal covert surveillance

Unauthorized installation of audio equipment

Psychological manipulation through false AI simulation


The power imbalance created is extreme. Victims are left desensitized, unable to rely on support systems, and forced to carry the psychological burden alone.


7. Inescapability of the System

The system is pervasive: no relocation to a new apartment or even a different country provides escape. Wherever I go, the system recreates similar conditions of victimization.

Attempts at medical intervention are complicated. For example, doctors have repeatedly told me: “These are not hallucinations.” While supportive, this also indicates how deeply the system controls my attention, even directing where I look or how my focus is interrupted.


8. Conclusion

This system is not only a personal burden but a public danger. It exploits automation and AI simulation to create psychological manipulation, operates through illegal surveillance, and impacts families and communities beyond the immediate victim.

Legal intervention, family awareness, and professional support are urgently needed to:

1. Disable the system.


2. Hold those responsible accountable.


3. Provide recovery and protection for those affected.
