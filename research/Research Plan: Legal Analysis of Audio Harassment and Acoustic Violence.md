# Research Plan: Legal Analysis of Audio Harassment and Acoustic Violence

## 1. Research Framework Enhancement

### 1.1 Expanded Research Questions
**Primary Questions:**
- How do different legal frameworks define and prosecute acoustic harassment across jurisdictions?
- What evidentiary standards create barriers to successful prosecution?
- What are the financial, psychological, and social impacts on victims?

**Secondary Questions (Missing from Original):**
- How do intersectional factors (race, class, disability, housing status) affect case outcomes?
- What role does technology play in both perpetration and evidence gathering?
- How do civil vs. criminal legal pathways differ in effectiveness?
- What preventative measures show promise in reducing acoustic violence?

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework
**Legal Theory Integration:**
- **Restorative Justice Theory**: Examine alternative dispute resolution mechanisms
- **Critical Legal Studies**: Analyse how power dynamics affect legal outcomes
- **Environmental Justice Theory**: Consider acoustic pollution as environmental harm
- **Disability Rights Framework**: Address impacts on neurodivergent individuals and those with sensory sensitivities

## 2. Methodological Improvements

### 2.1 Sampling Strategy Refinement
**Current Limitations Addressed:**
- **Geographic Bias**: Expand beyond Dublin base to include rural/urban comparative analysis
- **Demographic Representation**: Ensure inclusion of vulnerable populations (elderly, disabled, low-income)

- 15 law enforcement officers (various ranks and specializations)
- 10 acoustic/audio forensic experts
- 5 mental health professionals specializing in trauma
- 5 housing/community mediation specialists

### 2.2 Data Collection Enhancement
**Multi-Method Approach:**
1. **Longitudinal Case Studies**: Follow 5-10 active cases through entire legal process
2. **Court Observation**: Systematic observation of hearings/trials
3. **Document Analysis**: Include police reports, medical records, housing authority files
4. **Survey Component**: Large-scale survey of legal professionals' experiences
5. **Experimental Element**: Test effectiveness of different evidence-gathering technologies

### 3.2 Legal Doctrine Analysis
**Doctrinal Elements to Examine:**
- **Tort Law**: Nuisance, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress
- **Criminal Law**: Harassment, stalking, breach of peace, assault
- **Human Rights Law**: Right to peaceful enjoyment of property, right to private life
- **Housing Law**: Tenancy rights, housing authority powers
- **Evidence Law**: Admissibility of audio recordings, expert testimony standards

### 3.3 Case Law Analysis
**Systematic Review Protocol:**
- Database searches across multiple legal databases
- Citation analysis of key precedent cases
- Analysis of successful appeal strategies
- Examination of dismissal reasons in unsuccessful cases

## 4. Financial Impact Analysis Enhancement
