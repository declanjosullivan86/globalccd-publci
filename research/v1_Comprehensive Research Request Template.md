## 5. Outliers, Anomalies & Edge Cases

### 5.1 Statistical Outliers
- **Exceptional Cases:** Examples that don't fit general patterns
- **Rare Phenomena:** Low-frequency but significant occurrences
- **Boundary Conditions:** Where normal rules don't apply

### 5.2 Contradictory Examples
- **Black Swan Events:** Highly improbable but impactful cases
- **Paradoxical Findings:** Results that seem to contradict logic or theory
- **Cultural Exceptions:** How different contexts produce different outcomes

## 6. Critical Analysis & Synthesis

### 6.1 Strength of Evidence
- **Methodological Rigor:** Quality of research supporting each position
- **Replication:** How well findings have been reproduced
- **Meta-Analysis:** What large-scale reviews reveal

### 6.2 Gaps & Uncertainties
