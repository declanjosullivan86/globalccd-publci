- Maximum 30% of sources from any single research group/institution
- At least 60% of major claims supported by 2+ independent sources

## Section 3: Argument Structure Assessment
**Quality Weight: 20% of total score**

### 3.1 Logical Coherence Scoring (Per argument)
- **Premise Quality** (0-3): Are underlying assumptions stated and justified?
- **Reasoning Chain** (0-3): Does conclusion follow logically from evidence?
- **Counter-evidence Address** (0-3): Are opposing views fairly represented?

### 3.2 Argument Completeness Checklist
For each major position, verify:
- [ ] **Scope Definition:** Clear boundaries of applicability stated
- [ ] **Mechanism Explanation:** How/why the argument works is explained
- [ ] **Limitation Acknowledgment:** Where the argument breaks down is noted
- [ ] **Alternative Consideration:** Other explanations are discussed

**Quality Gate:** Arguments scoring <6/9 require revision or exclusion

## Section 4: Contradiction & Outlier Analysis
**Quality Weight: 20% of total score**

### 4.1 Contradiction Taxonomy
- **Direct Contradictions** (Must identify 2-5)
  - Evidence directly refuting mainstream claims
  - Score based on quality of contradicting evidence using Section 2 criteria
  
- **Conditional Contradictions** (Must identify 3-7)
  - Context-dependent exceptions to general rules
  - Cultural, temporal, or situational variations

### 4.2 Outlier Analysis Protocol
For each outlier case:
- **Verification Status:** Is the outlier independently confirmed? (Yes/No)
- **Mechanism Understanding:** Is there a plausible explanation? (0-3)
- **Frequency Assessment:** How rare is this exception? (Quantify if possible)
- **Impact Analysis:** Does this outlier require theory modification? (0-3)

**Outlier Quality Standards:**
- Minimum 5 verified outliers across different subtopics
- At least 60% must have proposed explanatory mechanisms
- Statistical outliers must include confidence intervals/significance tests

## Section 5: Synthesis Quality Assessment
**Quality Weight: 15% of total score**

### 5.1 Integration Scoring
- **Coherence** (0-5): Do all sections connect logically?
- **Completeness** (0-5): Are major aspects of the topic covered?
- **Balance** (0-5): Are different perspectives given appropriate weight?
- **Uncertainty Handling** (0-5): Are knowledge gaps clearly identified?

### 5.2 Practical Validity Tests
- **Application Examples:** Can the analysis predict real-world outcomes?
- **Expert Review Simulation:** Would domain experts find gaps or errors?
- **Replication Potential:** Could someone else reproduce this analysis?

## Section 6: Advanced Quality Control Mechanisms

### 6.1 Bias Detection Protocol
**Confirmation Bias Check:**
- Are sources selected to support a predetermined conclusion?
- Is contradictory evidence given fair weight?
- Are search terms neutral or loaded?

**Authority Bias Check:**
- Are famous names/institutions quoted without scrutiny?
- Are contrarian experts dismissed without engagement?

**Recency Bias Check:**
- Is older research dismissed without methodological justification?
- Are established findings overlooked for newer claims?

### 6.2 Methodological Red Flags
Automatic quality reduction for:
- Cherry-picking data points without statistical context
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Extrapolating beyond sample parameters
- Ignoring methodological limitations in cited studies
- Making universal claims from limited evidence

### 6.3 Completeness Verification Matrix

**Domain Coverage Audit:**
- [ ] Historical development adequately traced
- [ ] Multiple theoretical frameworks considered
- [ ] Cross-cultural perspectives included (where relevant)
- [ ] Recent developments (past 2 years) incorporated
- [ ] Interdisciplinary connections mapped
- [ ] Practical applications addressed
- [ ] Future research directions identified

- Section 6 (Bias/Completeness): ___/25 × 0.05 = ___

**Total Score: ___/100**

### 7.2 Quality Certification Levels
- **90-100:** Research-grade analysis suitable for academic publication
- **80-89:** Professional-grade analysis suitable for policy/business decisions
- **70-79:** Adequate analysis requiring minor improvements
- **60-69:** Substandard analysis requiring major revision
- **Below 60:** Inadequate analysis requiring complete restart

### 7.3 Improvement Protocol
For scores below certification threshold:
1. Identify lowest-scoring sections
2. Apply specific remediation strategies
3. Re-evaluate with independent scoring
4. Document improvements made

## Section 8: Advanced Anti-Gaming Measures

### 8.1 Quality Verification Challenges
- **Source Verification:** Random checks of 20% of citations for accuracy
- **Claim Verification:** Independent fact-checking of key assertions
- **Logic Verification:** Formal logic checks on argument structures

### 8.2 Robustness Tests
- **Perspective Shift Test:** Does the analysis hold when viewed from different stakeholder perspectives?
- **Time Shift Test:** Would conclusions be different with 5-year-old vs. current data?
- **Scope Shift Test:** Do patterns hold at different scales (individual vs. institutional vs. societal)?

## Usage Instructions

### Implementation Protocol
1. **Pre-Analysis Setup:**
   - Define topic scope and boundaries
   - Set minimum quality thresholds for each section
   - Establish independent verification procedures

2. **During Analysis:**
   - Apply scoring criteria continuously, not just at the end
   - Flag potential quality issues in real-time
   - Maintain audit trail of sources and reasoning

3. **Post-Analysis:**
   - Complete formal quality assessment
   - Address any gaps or weaknesses
   - Document final quality certification level

### Customization Guidelines
- **Academic Use:** Increase evidence quality requirements, add peer review simulation
- **Business Use:** Emphasize practical applications, add cost-benefit analysis
- **Public Policy:** Add stakeholder analysis, emphasize uncertainty quantification
- **Personal Research:** Adjust scope and depth requirements based on resources

This enhanced framework incorporates rigorous quality assessment mechanisms while maintaining comprehensiveness, ensuring that research meets professional standards while avoiding common pitfalls.
