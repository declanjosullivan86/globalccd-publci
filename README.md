## Purpose

Leveraging public sharing is a powerful way to diminish the impact of intimidation and stress caused by audio harassment. 

When a long-lasting crime is met with inaction or communication issues within a family, it can feel overwhelming and isolating.

This site helps to break that cycle by:

**Breaking the Isolation:**
- Sharing experiences helps individuals realize they are not alone. This collective knowledge can be a source of strength and validation.

**Creating Accountability:**
- Public documentation can pressure unresponsive individuals and institutions to take action. When a problem is no longer hidden, it becomes harder to ignore.

**Diminishing the Harasser's Power:**
- Harassment thrives in secrecy. By speaking out and documenting incidents, the narrative is reclaimed, and the abuse is exposed, which can significantly reduce a harasser's ability to intimidate.

Ultimately, this site helps transform a private crisis into a public resource for collective action, reducing the emotional toll and building a foundation for change.
